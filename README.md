## Installation

Install the gatsby CLI:

    npm install -g gatsby-cli

For detailed instructions, see
[here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/#installation-guide).

Install dependencies:
    
    npm install

Start the dev server:

    gatsby develop

Even if you have Node 14.5 you might get an error:

    Gatsby requires Node.js 14.15.0 or higher (you have v14.5.0)

Install the latest node and you should be good to go.

You should now be able to view the site at http://localhost:8000/.

This project is based off the [gatsby default
starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default), so for now,
that's a good place to go for information
