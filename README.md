For detailed instructions, see
[here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/#installation-guide).

Start the dev server:

    gatsby develop

You should now be able to view the site at http://localhost:8000/.

This project is based off the [gatsby default
starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default), so for now,
that's a good place to go for information
