Hi! Welcome to the OBH public directory GitHub repository's site-text folder.

Here you can make updates to the OBH public directory site by editing these files. 

To make a change to the site, navigate into one of the files above. If you're new to making changes, try opening one of the files above in a new tab so you can follow along with this ReadMe while making changes (Right click file -> open in new tab). You'll see something like:

You'll see something like:

```

slug: "main-page-blurb"

Pardon our dust

```

The `--- slug: ... ---` section tells you what part of the website you are editing.

Below that, you can edit current text or insert new text where you want to make a change.

Go ahead and make your edits, and then scroll to the bottom to create a pull request.

You can add a pull request title (where it says "Create {filename}.md") and description. Please give your pull request a description of the change, and make sure that your branch name begins with your first and last name (i.e. "AddisonDunn-change-providers-list").

Click "Propose changes". Here you will be taken to a screen to create the pull request. 
Here you can refine your description if you like. If you can add the label "site-text-changes" on the right-hand side panel that'd be great, but otherwise click "create pull request" and you should be good to go!
